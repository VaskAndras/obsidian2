Hi Max,
I read your story with a deep understanding. Stories like this are the reason why I don't like to use someone else's stuff. I never asked anybody to give me their phone, and I also hate to give mine to somebody.  
The main problem is the responsibility, in thease situations it is not decidable whose fault it was. You gave him the phone, so you gave it to a stranger. You can't ask him to take the responsibility for the past. I understand your position, you don't want to pay the bill for someone else's fault, but now it is necessary. It wouldn't be a good solution to call his father. I think it would  just lead to conflict.
Unfortunately these is nothing you can do. But next time do not gave your phone to a stranger!
I'm so sorry!
Best regards
Andras Vasko
