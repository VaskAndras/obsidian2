Dear Ms Bennett,
At the university we have to do 50 hour volunteer-work before our last exam. That is why, I was searching for a volunteer job when I found your advertisement on the internet. 
At my mandatory work, I want to do something good for the world. I find the animals situation very important. 
I am a university student, at communication and marketing course, so the work with people is close to me. I also like to attend local events, advertise something witch I believe in.
I look forward to work with you. 
I am waiting for your quick answer.
Yours sincerely
Andras Vasko

Hi Any,
I read your story with deep understanding. It's really hard to tell somebody something like that. But I think you must do something against that. 
Being rude at public is not a unique problem.  I know many many people who are change their personality when they're in an unfamiliar environment.  I can't accept this behavior, but I can understand why are people rude with a stranger.
The main reason of this behavior, is Pete's personality. He unable to trust in the people. This isn't a rare thing in our region. The people from East-Middle Europe are more unfriendly than American people. 
Think it would be helpful if you say him in a very polite way that, if he would more polite with the people, they will be also more polite.   
I hope I could help you. 
Best Regard:
Andras
