Dear Ms Fielding,
I have decided to to a barista course, while I am studying at the University. I have seen your advertisement on a bill, and your course picked my interest prompt. 
I love coffee since am I really young. Now, I am studying business marketing here in Manchester, and after the uni i would like to open my own caffé. So that is the purpose of my application.
Because of my classes, I would prefer the evening attachments on a workday. At the weekends usually I go home.
I would be happy, if i could get some more information about the courses. Especially about the fees and the course lengths, to know, how could I calculate with this program.
I am waiting for your answer prompt
Yours sincerely
András Vaskó

Francesca:
When I was reading your story, I remembered one of my old friend, who have done almost the same thing. He get in our class, and asked everybody to lend him some money. Sometimes somebody gave him some, but they never got them money back. Once, some of his friends had enough, and told him to hang that off, and he understood and apologized from us. This story is the reason, why I never borrow anything.
The main purpose of my storytelling is, to see the talking could be a good solution. Just speak with her. 
In this talking you can understand deeper her opinion and get to know the truth. The problem could be many thing, like her bad cash-flow or some unexpected expense. 
The best could be that, is you speak this with your parents, and together make a solution.
I hope I could help you.
