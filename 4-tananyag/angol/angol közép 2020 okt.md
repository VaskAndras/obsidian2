Dear Kushal,
I saw your advertisement about your yoga course. It caught my attention prompt, so I decided to apply for it. 
During my secondary grammar I attended a yoga course, and I really enjoyed it.  
Now I decided to be a yoga instructor. I want to lead courses for a salary during my university years.
I want to acquire some more information about your course. Mainly I would like to know the exact fees of the training, includeing the price of the book. If it is unable to be bought from you, I would be delighted If you could send me a website, where I can order it. 
I am looking  forward to your reply 
Yours sincerely:
András Vaskó
